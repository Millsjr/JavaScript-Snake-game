# 🐍 The Ever-Growing Serpent: A Classic Snake Game!
Get ready to slither your way to glory in this timeless arcade classic, built right in your browser! This isn't just any snake game; it's a journey back to pixelated fun where every bite makes you bolder (and longer!).

## 🎮 How to Play
It's super simple, even a snake could do it!

Arrow Keys: Use your Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys to guide your hungry serpent.

Eat the Red Square: Your mission? Gobble up those juicy red squares that appear on the screen. Each one makes your snake grow!

Don't Bite Yourself (Too Hard!): If your snake's head collides with its own ever-growing body, well, let's just say it's a minor setback. Your tail will reset, but the game keeps going!

Wrap Around: Don't worry about hitting the walls! Our snake is a master of teleportation and will magically reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

## ✨ Features
