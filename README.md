# JavaScript-Snake-game
One of my first JavaScript coding projects


This was my first JavaScript Project. I am aware that most of the true developers are more advanced. 
This is my attempt at something new and exciting. I see how important it is to have fun, and I am proud to create a fun, classic game.
I feel this is just the beginning of a healthy addiction I have for developing. 

I also would like to attach a song to some of my posts. 
I feel as if they may encourage others to research inspiration, and drive you to develop as well.
